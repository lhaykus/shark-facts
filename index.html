        <h1> Shark Facts</h1>
        <p>Sharks are some of the most incredible predators in the world. With their mighty size, their
            rocket-like approach to hunting and their undeniably large teeth,
            sharks have been the top predator roaming our oceans for millions of years. Yet, they are not the man
            killers everyone makes them out to be.
            Thanks to movies like 'Jaws' and the human nature to fear what you dont understand, sharks have been victims
            to being demonized by the world,
            when in fact these creatures are beautiful works of nature. These amazing creatures are facing more and more
            grave dangers as the years go on.
            A study from <cite><span><a target='blank'

                        PEWTrusts.org </a></span></cite> shows that since 1970, shark populations have dropped 70%. It
            is up to us to save these predators from extinction so that our oceans
            can thrive and so can all life on earth!</p>

        <h3>How to Help</h3>
        <img src="./assets/whale-shark.jpg" width="45%" height="45%" align='left'>
        <li class="help"><span style='font-weight:bold'>Read your labels:</span> Many differnt types of products varying
            from
            cosmetics, to pet food, to skincare are known to have shark in their ingriedents. The mislabeling of fish in
            stores and markets
            have also been known to contain shark while trying to sell off as another fish. Squalene, an oil obtained
            from shark liver, is a popular shark product. </li>
        <li><span style='font-weight:bold'>Stop shark finning:</span> <cite><span><a target='blank'
                        href="https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/sharks-rays/shark-finning-sharks-turned-prey">Shark
                        finning</a></span></cite> is one of the biggest threats
            to sharks today. With the social staus of shark fin soup in some cultures and the high price that comes from
            shark fins, sharks are being brutally killed by having their fins cut off and being thrown back into the
            ocean to drown (most sharks need to move to breath, and without fins they cant move) and bleed to death on
            the ocean floor.
            There is no real benefit to eating shark and their fins yet millions die a year in gruesome deaths.</li>
        <li><span style='font-weight:bold'>Educate Yourself:</span> Human nature is to fear what you don't understand.
            Too many people view sharks as these villian creatures and think the solution is to rid of them to make
            people safe. If people took the time
            to educate themselves on the nautre and habits of sharks, most people would come to realize they are
            amazing, incredible beings who are just living in their world, that we are stepping into. With a better
            understanding of creatures other than us, we can work
            to learn how to coexist.</li>
        <li><span style='font-weight:bold'>Know the risks:</span> The reality is the ocean is the sharks domian and they
            are the apex predator in their own world. Humans are not native to the ocean and our ability to survive is
            limited when it comes to water.
            There will always be a risk when stepping into the ocean of coming across a shark and there will always be a
            risk of a shark attack, even if not meant. When you know the risks you will be better educated on how to
            handle a situation with a shark but will also be able to make the
            decision to not be in the ocean in sharks make you uncomfortable. The ocean is their home, not ours and we
            need to learn how to share, not just kick them out.</li>

                are whales with teeth and make up almost 90% of the whale population. Dolphins and sperm whales are
                examples of toothed whales. Baleen Whales are filter feeding whales.
                Instead of teeth they have baleen which are like the equivalent of fingernails on a human. These are
                used to strain the water that comes into their mouth, filtering out the
                small krill most of these whales eat. Humpbacks,

            <li><span style='font-weight:bold'>End Captivity:</span> One of the biggest threats that whales have faced,
                especially Orcas, is captivity. It is estimated that since 1961 at least <cite><span><a target='blank'
                        href="https://us.whales.org/our-4-goals/end-captivity/orca-captivity/">166 orcas</a></span></cite> have
                been taken from the wild and put into captivity for human entertainment. These animals are then kept in
                very small cages and trained to do
                tricks for an audience, not the life wild animals (or any animal) should be living. Since the release of
                documentaries, such as Blackfish, the world has become more aware of the inhumane practices and many
                have vowed to no longer bring new
                whales into their faculities. However, across the world, these whales are still kept in small, cramped
                and unliveable spaces, which can lead to sickness, bordeom, self-harm and death. </li>
            <li><span style='font-weight:bold'>End Commercial Whaling:</span> While whaling is illegal is most places
                <cite><a target="blank" href="https://us.whales.org/our-4-goals/stop-whaling/"></a>Iceland, Norway and
                    Japan</cite> still kill thousands of whales a year through whaling.
                Many of these whales are killed for their blubber and to be sold into the food and pharmasutical
                industries. Many whale populations have been brought dangeroulsy close to extintion including the
                <cite><span><a target="blank" href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/whale">blue whale</a></span></cite>
                which was almost brought to complete extintion in the 20th century. The practice of commercial whaling
                is cruel and unnecassary for the world we live in today. While some cultures
                do live off of whale meat, the mass murder of thousands a year just for their blubber is what needs to
                stop.
            </li>
            <li><span style='font-weight:bold'>Reduce Pollution:</span> It is no secret that one of the biggest threats

                pounds of unbiodegradable trash and substances that get thrown into nature. With the increasing plastic,
                fishing nets, oils and toxins being thrown into the ocean, more and more whales are
                washing up on our shores filled with human-made items in their stomachs. If we can keep our oceans
                clean, these animals wouldnt have to worry about eating plastic, getting strangled by fishing nets
