<p align='center'>  I love the ocean and this is a page dedicated to the knowledge of sharks and whales, and how to help protect them and the oceans. Here you will find shark facts, whale facts, tips on how to help them and the oceans and some personal favorite organizatoins to support. I played around with parallax styling and boostrap to create this webpage.  </p>
